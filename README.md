# Connect-hub-smart-event-grouping-system
A simple command-line Event Management System built with Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This tool allows users to:

Add, update, and manage people

Create and manage events with optional age, gender, and member limit restrictions

Allow people to join or leave events

View system statistics (e.g. total users, known vs unknown, events)

All data is stored in-memory, and the interface is fully menu-driven, making it easy to test and use without external dependencies.
